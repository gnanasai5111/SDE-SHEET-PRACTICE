### Dynamic Programming

- Dynamic Programming is a method used in mathematics and computer science to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. By solving each subproblem only once and storing the results, it avoids redundant computations, leading to more efficient solutions for a wide range of problems.

- Dynamic programming is divided into two main approaches: top-down (memoization) and bottom-up (tabulation).

## Top-Down DP (Memoization)

In the top-down approach, also known as memoization, we start with the original problem and break it down into subproblems. Think of it like starting at the top of a tree and working your way down to the leaves.

## Bottom-Up DP (Tabulation)

The bottom-up approach, also known as tabulation, takes the opposite direction. This approach solves problems by breaking them up into smaller ones, solving the problem with the smallest mathematical value, and then working up to the problem with the biggest value.
